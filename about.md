## Developer Relations & Community

I lead a **5,000+ developer community in San Francisco**, running meetups, hack nights, and hands‚Äëon workshops. My DevRel work focuses on:

- **Education & Enablement:** live workshops, lab guides, code samples, reference architectures, and demo apps that shorten time‚Äëto‚Äëfirst‚Äësuccess.
- **Content & Docs:** technical blogs, quickstarts, SDK examples, and integration guides aligned to real developer workflows.
- **Programs & Partnerships:** shaping event series, co‚Äëmarketing with ecosystem partners, and community feedback loops for product roadmaps.
- **On‚Äëthe‚Äëground advocacy:** authentic, technical conversations that build trust‚Äîthen convert into usage, contributions, and retained community health.

> If you‚Äôre hiring for **Developer Advocacy / DevRel**, I can stand up programs from zero, grow meetups, or serve as a fractional lead while coaching internal champions.
